Motivation:
This CANDI application obtains 3 different types of annotations to characterize a radiograph

Background:
Original images from openI are housed on an AWS server running CANDI that hosts this domain.  see https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/gridquery.php?q=&it=xg&coll=cxr

General Instructions:
To begin, enter your user name and click "Begin Annotating"
  if you're disconnected or need a break, you can exit and resume later by returning to this page and entering your name exactly the same way (case-sensitive)

Select any diagnosis that is evident in the radiograph.  You cannot proceed to the next radiograph until at least entering this data.
If you indicate the presence of any diagnoses, additional submission buttons will appear to localize the disease.  Click and drag on the radiograph to indicate the pathology and submit.
You can submit multiple boxes for a single illness if indicated.
Optionally enter a textual description of the radiograph.

Click "Next Image" to proceed to the next case.


Supplementary Instructions:
to download all annotations, use the correspondign "Download" links which will aggregate all records and initiate a browser download of a CSV file.
