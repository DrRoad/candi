Motivation:
This CANDI application is used to generate ground truth labels to score a classification algorithm

Background:
These images were obtained from the openI chest x-ray database at https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/gridquery.php?q=&it=xg&coll=cxr
Images are supplied with their associated original clinical radiology note and curator's structured interpretations of the note

General Instructions:
To begin, enter your user name and click "Begin Trial"
  if you're disconnected or need a break, you can exit and resume later by returning to this page and entering your name exactly the same way (case-sensitive)

A test case will be displayed along with the patient's history of present illness, original radiology note and dataset curators' abstractions of the note.
Use the arrows above the test radiograph to scroll through all the images acquired for this case

Using all available information, please indicate all diagnoses that are evident from the radiographs and supporting data

Supplemenatary Instructions:
If you'd like to review statistics on your annotated image set, click the "Show/hide annotation stats" text at the bottom of the page.
This provides information on the disease prevalence in case you're trying to annotate a target number of pathology cases, and the time it has taken per case so you can estimate and plan further data generation.
